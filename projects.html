								Team Pneumonia aims to create an aggregated diagnostic tool or device which will aid those in under-developed countries to attain an accurate measurement and diagnosis of pneumonia, preventing a misdiagnosis as malaria or other bronchial diseases. Our tool will be intuitive to use, allowing for a preliminary diagnosis outside of a strict medical setting which can be difficult to come by for many who are susceptible to pneumonia. Our team is currently in the process of researching the most accurate diagnostic tests for pneumonia identification and we hope to develop models for a prospective device soon.

					<p class = "titles"><strong>Larvae Tracking software</strong></p2>

						<p>
							Developing Python program to track the crawling distance of drosophila larvae for neural plasticity research.The software identifies key markers on the larvae and tracks the movement of markers to log crawling distance.

					<p class = "titles"><strong>Optognetics stimulation device</strong></p2>
						<p>
							Invented automated Arduino controlled light stimulation device and developed custom test protocols for optogeneteicstimulation experiments on drosophila. This systems uses PID control algorithms for measurement and correction of light output from LEDs to predefined intensitiesand wavelengths, which specifically enhanced speed, efficiency, and accuracy of LED stimulation. This device was used in the publication <em>Sensory experience shapes development of the nociceptive circuit in Drosophila</em>, currently in submission.

						<p>
							Investigated feasibility of constructing wearable stun-gun for women in India (circuit design, CAD, safety, pricing). I consulted for a team of businesses students who traveled throughout India for three weeks in order to create a business proposal. Project won first place in the Ross Social Challenge over seven competing teams.
